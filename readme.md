# PropValue Pune

PropValue Pune is a project aimed at determining the approximate price of houses in Pune, India, based on various input parameters such as square footage, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms (BHK), and location.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the Pune house data to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to present the data in an easily understandable format.
- Feature Engineering: Transforming the existing features and creating new features to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Train-Test Split: Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Model Building: Developing a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the given input parameters.
- Flask Server: Building a Flask server to handle user inputs and serve the predictions.
- Web Application: Creating a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.


## Model Performance

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 81% in predicting house prices in Pune. This accuracy metric provides an indication of how well the model performs in estimating the prices based on the given input parameters.
