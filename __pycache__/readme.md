## Project Overview
The project follows the following steps:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Analyzing the Pune house data to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables.
### Data Visualization: 
Creating visualizations to present the data in an easily understandable format.
### Feature Engineering: 
Transforming the existing features and creating new features to improve the predictive power of the model.
### Train-Test Split:
 Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
### Model Building:
 Developing a machine learning model to predict the house prices based on the given input parameters.
### Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the accuracy of the model's predictions.
### Model Performance:
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 81% in predicting house prices in Pune. This accuracy metric provides an indication of how well the model performs in estimating the prices based on the given input parameters.
